Simple Game Framework

A Simple C++ framework for writing games for Windows, Linux and WebAssembly.

SGF is a simple CMake based project so you should be able to open it in any CMake compatible C++ IDE such as MSVC C/C++ 2022, QtCreator or CLion.

For example, on Windows 10:

* Install Git.
* Install MSVC Community Edition 2022.
* git clone https://github.com/blitz-research/sgf.git somewhere.
* Start MSVC, click 'Open Folder...' and select the git folder.
* Change 'startup item' to 'hellobox.exe'.
* Click 'build and run'.

Linux:

* Pretty much the same as windows, but using QtCreator instead of MSVC.
